## TCLAP - Templatized Command Line Argument Parser

This is a slimmed down repo with only the required headers for TCLAP.

TCLAP is a simple C++ library that facilitates parsing command line
arguments in a type independent manner.  It doesn't conform exactly
to either the GNU or POSIX standards, although it is close.

I did not write this code and this is here intended just for my own use in toy/hobby projects.

Also see the licence.
